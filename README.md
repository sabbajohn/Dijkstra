## **_Dijkstra Algorithm_**
Recently, I have been inspired to study and implement various fundamental algorithms. This is the first one that I will be focusing on: Dijkstra's Algorithm. Throughout my journey of learning and experimentation, I have also developed a graphical representation of this algorithm which aims to facilitate educational purposes.

## **Compilation**
    $ gcc -o dijkstra_visual dijkstra_visual.c -lSDL2 -lSDL2_ttf
